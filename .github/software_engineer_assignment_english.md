# Senior Software Engineer Assignment (Backend)

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to test your ability to research, analyze problems, and arrive at the best possible technical solution.

## Technologies Used at Thamania for Project Development

At Thamania, we use various technologies to build our products (may vary from project to project).

- **TypeScript** to ensure higher quality outputs and reduce errors during the development process.
- **Amazon Web Services** as a cloud service for running software.
- **Nest.js or Fastify** as a framework for system development.
- **Databases**
  - SQL (Postgres)
  - NoSQL (DynamoDB)

## Assignment

The final output of this assignment is to build a two-component system that stores and displays program episodes for users, consisting of the following:

### 1. Content Management System (CMS)

An internal system that allows users (e.g., editors or content managers) to:

a. Enter or edit visual programs (podcasts or documentaries, you can refer to the Thamantham channel on YouTube).

b. Customize metadata such as: title, description, category, language, duration, publication date.

c. 💡 The system enables its users to import data from multiple sources in the future.

### 2. Discovery System

Allows general users to search for programs through the content system.

## Assignment Evaluation Criteria

- **Endpoints** that serve front-end developers, with good documentation.

- We prefer that you solve the problem using **NestJS** or **Golang**, but if you haven't used these technologies before and find it difficult to implement the solution using them, we have no problem with that. Implement the solution using technologies that suit you.

- Assume that this system must be **scalable** to handle up to **10 million users per hour**.

- You can choose the database you deem appropriate, and the search method you deem appropriate. The important thing is to follow the most effective approach for designing tables and relationships.

- Make sure to follow **SOLID** principles and that the program has the lowest possible degree of **coupling** with a clear definition of **module boundaries**.

- Finally, after you finish implementing the solution in the way you find appropriate, we want you to write a simple document explaining your approach to solving the problem, the main difficulties you faced, and if you have any suggestions or ideas for solving the problem in a different or better way.
